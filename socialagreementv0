>>The purpose of The Sky Collective
To facilitate connections.
To share resources and best practices.
To initiate collective projects (non-monetary and monetary generating) to practice self-management.
To find and bring new to the community projects that would benefit from support.

>>Decision making
Wherever possible, The Sky Collective uses Loomio for decision making. There are three tiers of decision making:
Automonous
For decisions that are easily reversed, have only short term implications (<6 months) and low cost of implementation (<US$100). Trust in the decision-maker’s capacity to make the decision, and support for the decision, is implicit.
Consent
For decisions that are harder or more costly to reverse, have medium-term implications (6-18 months) or significant costs of implementation (>US$100). Decisions are passed if all involved agree that:
“I can see no reason why this decision would cause harm to the individuals involved or The Sky Collective as a whole.”
Advice
For decisions that are irreversible, have long-term implications (>18 months) or substantial costs of implementation (>US$500). One or more Co-owners will be tasked with implementing the advice process, calling on the support and input of other Co-owners and Members (as well as outside expertise) as required.
